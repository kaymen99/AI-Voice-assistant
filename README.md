source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages:**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

5. **Configure Google API credentials:**
