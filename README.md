- Deepgram API key (for voice processing)

- Necessary Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Voice-assistant.git
cd AI-Voice-assistant
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages:**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

5. **Configure Google API credentials:**

Follow Google's documentation to set up credentials for Calendar, Contacts, and Gmail APIs. Save the credentials file in a secure location and update the path in the configuration file.

### Running the Application

1. **Start a conversation with the assistant:**
